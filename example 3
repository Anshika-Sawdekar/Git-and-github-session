When you listen to music, especially songs with strong rhythmic beats, your heartbeat and even your breathing can start to synchronize with the tempo. Fast-paced music can increase your heart rate, while slow, calming music can slow it down.

Even more wildâ€”when people sing together in a group (like in choirs), their heartbeats often synchronize too. It's like the body tunes into a shared rhythm, literally.
